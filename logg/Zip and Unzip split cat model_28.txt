tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file

tar -czvf model_28.pt.gz model_28.pt

Here’s what those switches actually mean:

    -c: Create an archive.
    -z: Compress the archive with gzip.
    -v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as “verbose” mode. The v is always optional in these commands, but it’s helpful.
    -f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive.
